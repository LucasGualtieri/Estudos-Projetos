/*
	Yes, there are libraries available for implementing
	try-catch-like error handling in C. These libraries
	provide a mechanism to catch and handle exceptions
	in a structured manner, similar to the try-catch
	blocks in C++. Here are a few popular libraries:

	libunwind: libunwind is a library that provides
	low-level unwind and exception handling support
	for C applications. It allows you to catch and
	handle exceptions through the use of stack unwinding.
	It provides functions like _Unwind_RaiseException()
	to raise an exception and _Unwind_SetIP() to specify
	the instruction pointer to continue execution after
	handling the exception.

	setjmp/longjmp: The setjmp/longjmp functions provide
	a way to perform non-local jumps in C. While not exactly
	equivalent to try-catch, they can be used to handle
	exceptions in a similar way. The setjmp function sets
	up a "jump" point, and longjmp allows you to "jump" back
	to that point and continue execution from there, bypassing
	the normal function call/return sequence.
	By using setjmp/longjmp, you can achieve a form of
	exception handling in C.

	cexcept: cexcept is a C library that provides a
	try-catch-like exception handling mechanism. It defines
	macros and functions that allow you to declare and
	handle exceptions. It uses setjmp/longjmp internally
	to perform the exception handling.

	uthash: While not specifically designed for exception
	handling, uthash is a popular C library that provides
	hash table functionality. It uses macros to implement
	a "hashed exception" mechanism. You can use these macros
	to simulate try-catch behavior by wrapping sections of
	code that might throw exceptions and provide corresponding
	catch blocks to handle those exceptions.

	It's important to note that these libraries may have
	different syntax and behavior compared to the try-catch
	blocks in C++. Additionally, introducing exception handling
	mechanisms in C can increase the complexity of the code and
	may have performance implications. Therefore, it's recommended
	to carefully consider the trade-offs before using such
	libraries in your C projects.
